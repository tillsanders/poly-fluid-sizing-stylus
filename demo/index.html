    <h1>Demo of the Poly Fluid Sizing Mixin for Stylus</h1>
    <p>
      This is a demonstration of the Poly Fluid Sizing Mixin for Stylus. The code for this demo can
      be found
      <a href="https://github.com/tillsanders/poly-fluid-sizing-stylus/tree/master/demo">
        here.

      Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Something
      strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw
      something as tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our
      transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of
      wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.

      Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant
      failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust
      shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of
      power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions.
      Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.

      This stress test is scaling the font-size up and down, up and down. So if this looks strange,
      its working ;)
